# Chart Challenge

A challenge to myself to create and explore a new chart regularly

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- pnpm (or npm or yarn)

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:1234`

### Build

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

The optimized files will be in the `dist` folder.
