# Chart Challenge

A challenge to myself to create and explore a new chart regularly

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (or npm or yarn)

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Build

Create a static export build:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

The static files will be in the `out` folder, ready to be deployed to any static hosting service.

### Production Server

To test the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm start
```
