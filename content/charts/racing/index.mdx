import { Racing } from "./Racing";

Racing bar charts are pretty hokey, so of course I wanted to make one myself!

<div className="min-h-[700px] w-full">
  <Racing />
</div>

<div className="mt-8" />

Some takeaways:
- Acquiring, cleaning, and processing the data was way more difficult than making the charts
- ECharts effortlessly did a ton of the heavy lifting regarding animations and transitions
- Racing bar charts are definitely kind of silly, but they make for a fun demo
