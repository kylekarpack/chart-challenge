import { Racing } from "./Racing";

Racing bar charts are pretty silly, so of course I wanted to make one myself!
I saw one on [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/visualisations/bar-chart-race/) a few years ago, and it sure made for a fun demo.

<div className="min-h-[700px] w-full">
  <Racing />
</div>

<div className="mt-8" />

Some takeaways:
- Acquiring, cleaning, and processing the data was way more difficult than making the charts
- ECharts effortlessly did a ton of the heavy lifting regarding animations and transitions
- Racing bar charts are kind of ridiculous, and they aren't a terribly useful data visualization, but they're fun!
- I'm a Bayern fan - it gets better as it goes! <img className="inline" src="https://tmssl.akamaized.net//images/wappen/small/27.png" />
