How do a few different libraries handle large datasets? I didn't take the time to actually instrument the rendering performance, so the results are purely vibes-based.

Excuse the terrible UX here. As you click the buttons, charts will render. The performance may be terrible and you won't receive any loading feedback!

import { MuchData } from "./MuchData";

<div className="min-h-[800px] w-full">
  <MuchData />
</div>
