# Building Modern Web Apps with Next.js

Next.js has become the go-to framework for building React applications. Let's explore what makes it so special.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a **React framework** that provides:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- File-based routing
- Automatic code splitting
- Built-in optimization

## Key Features

### File-Based Routing

One of my favorite features is the intuitive file-based routing system. Create a file in the `app` directory, and it automatically becomes a route:

```
app/
  page.tsx          → /
  about/
    page.tsx        → /about
  blog/
    [slug]/
      page.tsx      → /blog/:slug
```

### Server Components

React Server Components are the default in the App Router. They enable:

- Zero bundle size for server-only code
- Direct database access
- Better performance
- Automatic static optimization

### Static Site Generation

Generate static pages at build time for maximum performance:

```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }));
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Next.js includes several built-in optimizations:

1. **Automatic Image Optimization**: The `Image` component optimizes images on-demand
2. **Font Optimization**: Automatically optimize and load fonts
3. **Script Optimization**: Control loading of third-party scripts
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Understand what's in your bundle

## Getting Started

Create a new Next.js app with:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

That's it! You now have a fully-featured Next.js application running locally.

## Conclusion

Next.js combines the best of static sites and dynamic applications. Whether you're building a blog, an e-commerce site, or a complex web app, Next.js has you covered.

*Happy coding!*
