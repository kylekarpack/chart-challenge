I recently saw a beautiful [TideLog](https://www.tidelog.com/product/puget-sound-2/) book in a bookstore on Bainbridge Island.
I wasn't able to fully replicate the gorgeous design that went into its charts, but I wanted to see if could make them interactive. 

Uses NOAA's [tides and currents API](https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/) to get data for the current day for Seattle.

import { TideCharts } from "./TideCharts";

<div className="min-h-[700px] w-full">
  <TideCharts />
</div>

<div className="mt-8" />

Some takeaways:
- Replicating a precise chart is pretty difficult
- ECharts has a lot of functionality for design, but some is a little hard to find in the documentation
