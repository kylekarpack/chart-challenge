import { HikeHistogram } from "./HikeHistogram";

<div className="min-h-[800px] w-full">
  <HikeHistogramSmallMultiples />
</div>

Things I learned:

- There are some considerations that need to be made when jamming this much infomation into a single page
  - Axis labels needed to be re-worked
  - This approach wouldn't work for many years of data. Imagine if I had been tracking for 20 or 30 years. I'd need to wrap the charts, or facet by multi-year time periods
- It was still hard to find an effective way to display four dimensions (year, duration, time, and ascent)
