  The primary purpose of this edition is to experiment with some advanced features of Observable Plot.

Things I learned:

- For small multiples charts, there are some considerations that need to be made when jamming this much infomation into a single page
  - Axis labels needed to be re-worked
  - This approach wouldn't work for many years of data. Imagine if I had been tracking for 20 or 30 years. I'd need to wrap the charts, or facet by multi-year time periods
- It was still hard to find an effective way to display four dimensions (year, duration, time, and ascent) in a single chart
- The transformations in Observable Plot are terse and powerful, but can be a little bit tricky to get the hang of
- Observable Plot's waffle chart is a little bit buggy, as are tooltips on charts with window transforms
