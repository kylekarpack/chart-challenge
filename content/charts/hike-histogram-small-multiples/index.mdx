I've been hiking a lot this decade, and I've been tracking my hikes with Gaia GPS.
Curious to see some stats on my hikes, I created some histograms to visualize various metrics.

import { HikeHistogram } from "./HikeHistogram";

<div className="min-h-[800px] w-full">
  <HikeHistogram />
</div>

Things I learned:
 - Histograms are pretty neat
